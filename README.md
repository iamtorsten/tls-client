# Disclaimer
This is a fork of FlorianREGAZ [tls-client](https://github.com/FlorianREGAZ/Python-Tls-Client). <br>
I created this fork because in the original repository the binaries were not updated and bugs remained open for too long.

# Usage
The project description can be found in the original repository. <br>
